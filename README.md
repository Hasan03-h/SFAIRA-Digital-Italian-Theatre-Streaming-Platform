🔹 Outreach & Marketing Preparation

Built an Outreach Database of 30+ contacts: influencers, theatre groups, schools, cultural organizations (Italy + global).

Drafted outreach email templates for both influencers and creators.

Suggested partnerships with independent creators already seeking crowdfunding → hosting their plays on Sfaira at low/no cost.
